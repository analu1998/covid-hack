The plan is to use Firebase Cloud Functions to store our server,
instead of using our own dedicated machine as a server and communicating externally to Firebase.
(On a side note, Firebase also has a hosting option if necessary - but not needed as of now)
Firebase cloud functions is by default a node.js application that runs.

To deploy changes to the firebase cloud functions. 
Run ONCE:
    npm -g install firebase-tools
    firebase login

Run after each time you modify the app:
    firebase deploy


Note that you have to be added to the project as an editor to run firebase deploy.
Contact me with your email, and I can add you to the project.
